#webglobe: Interactive 3D Maps

You want to do understand your data set, but it's spatially distributed and you're afraid that trying to make sense of it on something gross, like a Mercator projection, is going to lead you to bad intuitions.

(Greenland is nowhere near that big in reality.)

webglobe can help you do this! It allows you to interactively visualize your data on either a three-dimensional globe or a flat map.

#Examples

    library(webglobe)              #Load the library
    data(quakes)                   #Load up some data

    wg <- webglobe(immediate=TRUE) #Make a webglobe (should open a net browser)
    wg + wgpoints(quakes$lat, quakes$lon, size=10*quakes$mag)


#Roadmap

* Additional graphics primitives

* Submission to CRAN



#Credits

This R package was developed by Richard Barnes (http://rbarnes.org).

It uses the Cesium WebGL virtual globe and map engine ([link](https://cesiumjs.org/)).
